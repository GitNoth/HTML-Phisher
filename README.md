## SETUP

To set up the HTML Phisher, follow these steps:

1. **Add Your Discord Webhook URL**: Look for the marked section in the HTML file and replace it with your Discord Webhook URL. This ensures that the gathered information gets sent to your desired destination.

2. **Set Up Redirect URL**: In the HTML file, locate the marked section and replace it with the URL where you want the victims to be redirected after submitting their information. For example, if you want to redirect them to `https://rewards.linux.scot/fail`, replace `fail` with your desired URL endpoint.

3. **Customize Website Title**: Feel free to change the title of the phishing page by editing the HTML file. This allows you to personalize the appearance and make it more convincing.
